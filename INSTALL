BUILDING AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

On *nix, from the tarball:

	$ ./configure && make && sudo make install

	Pire uses GNU autotools, so all customizations of the build process
	(overriding compiler or its flags, installation into other directory,
	cross-compiling, etc...) is applicable for Pire as well.
	`./configure --help' gives you a brief description of those.

	If you want additional features placed in extra/ directory (CountingScanner,
	CapturingScanner and GlueSimilarGlyphs feature), add `--enable-extra' option
	to ./configure.

	If you want to build and run unit tests, install cppunit <http://cppunit.sourceforge.net>,
	add `--with-cppunit' option to ./configure and run `make check'.

	You will find stubs for package specs in pkg/ directories. You can use them for providing
	a package for your favourite distribution; your contribution will be highly appreciated.


On *nix, from VCS:

	You will need GNU autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool), bison, flex and cppunit.
	Please note that if you want to rebuild the tarball, cppunit is required, since its detection
	and using code is needed in configure script and makefiles.

	Once you have all this, simply run
	$ autoreconf --install && ./configure && make all check && sudo make install

	To rebuild the tarball, run `make distcheck'.


On Windows:

	Unpack the tarball and run `nmake -f pkg\Makefile.win32 all'.

	If you want to build bleeding edge version from VCS, you'll need to install bison, flex,
	cppunit and create a project on your own.
